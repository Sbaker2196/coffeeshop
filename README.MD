This System was build to showcase a reference architecture for Observability in distributed
systems, at its core it consists of four services and several other third-party services. 

The idea behind this application was to showcase an Event-Driven-Architecture, in which it is often 
difficult to trace the paths of communication within the application due to the distributed nature of the services
making up the system as a whole. 
The title of my thesis is the following: ***Applicability of Observability in Microservice-based Systems
based systems using the example of a demo application***

The following lines are closer and more in depth look at the: 
- components making up the base application
- technology stack used in the base application
- components making up the observability stack
- technology stack used in the observability stack
