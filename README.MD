## Introduction
This System was built to showcase a reference architecture for Observability in distributed
systems, at its core it consists of four services and several other third-party components. 

The idea behind this application was to represent an Event-Driven-Architecture, in which it is often 
difficult to trace the paths of communication within the application due to the distributed nature of the services
making up the system as a whole. 

The following lines are closer and more in depth look at the: 
- components making up the base application
- technology stack used in the base application
- components making up the observability stack
- technology stack used in the observability stack
